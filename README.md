## 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
```
User holds 0.5 BTC worth ~$22,500
→ Connect wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
→ FluxFi detects idle assets
```

### Step 2: Activate Yield
```
FluxFi analyzes all available vaults
→ Identifies Aave Polygon USDC as best option (5.2% APY)
→ Shows user: "You could earn $1,170/year"
→ User clicks "Activate Yield"
```

### Step 3: Automatic Swap (SideShift)
```
BTC → SideShift API → Polygon USDC
Amount: 0.5 BTC → $22,387.50 USDC (0.5% fee)
Time: < 2 minutes
Transaction: Trustless, non-custodial
```

### Step 4: Deposit to Vault
```
$22,387.50 USDC → Aave Polygon Smart Contract
→ Instantly earning 5.2% APY
→ Yield accrues every second
```

### Step 5: AI Optimization (24/7)
```
Every hour:
- Check all vault APYs
- If better opportunity found (>1% difference):
  - Withdraw from current vault
  - Swap to new vault
  - Resume earning
- Continuously optimize returns
```

### Step 6: Track & Withdraw
```
Dashboard shows:
- Original: 0.5 BTC
- Current Value: $22,387.50 USDC
- Earnings: +$127 after 1 month
- APY: 5.2%

Anytime user wants to withdraw:
- USDC → SideShift API → BTC
- BTC returned to original wallet
- No lock-ups or restrictions
```

## 💡 Why Polygon?

### 1. **Ultra-Low Fees**

### 2. **Lightning Fast**
- Ethereum: 12-30 seconds per block
- Polygon: 2-second blocks
- **Instant transactions**

### 3. **Top DeFi Protocols**
Polygon hosts the same top protocols as Ethereum:
- **Aave**: Lending/borrowing ($2B+ TVL)
- **Yearn**: Yield farming optimizer ($500M+ TVL)
- **Quickswap**: DEX with liquidity pools
- **Beefy**: Auto-compounding vault optimization

### 4. **Ethereum Security**
- Polygon is secured by Ethereum's validators
- Uses Plasma and ZK-rollup technology
- Audited and battle-tested

### 5. **User Experience**
- Users get better yields (Polygon fees are lower)
- Transactions confirm instantly
- More funds go into earning, less into fees

## 🔀 How SideShift Works

SideShift is a **cross-chain liquidity aggregator** that enables instant trustless swaps between any blockchain.

### The Problem SideShift Solves
```
Traditional approach:
1. Bridge BTC to Ethereum (20-60 minutes)
2. Swap on DEX (depends on liquidity)
3. Bridge to Polygon (20-60 minutes)
4. Total time: 40+ minutes
5. Multiple points of failure
```

### SideShift Solution
```
1. User deposits BTC to SideShift deposit address
2. SideShift detects deposit on Bitcoin blockchain
3. Immediately sends Polygon USDC to user wallet
4. Total time: < 2 minutes
5. Trustless: SideShift never controls your keys
```

### Why We Use SideShift
- ✅ **Instant**: 2-minute swaps vs. 40+ minutes
- ✅ **Trustless**: No private key required
- ✅ **Secure**: No wrapped tokens or intermediaries
- ✅ **Cross-chain**: Any blockchain to any blockchain
- ✅ **Low fees**: 0.5% competitive rates
- ✅ **Proven**: Billions in volume processed

## 📈 Example Earnings

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **Original Asset** | 0.5 BTC |
| **USD Value** | $22,500 |
| **Swap Fee (0.5%)** | -$112.50 |

| **APY** | 5.2% |
| **Annual Earnings** | $1,164 |
| **Monthly Earnings** | $97 |
| **Daily Earnings** | $3.19 |
| **Platform Fee (10% of yield)** | -$116.40 |

> 💡 **No deposit fees, no withdrawal fees - only swap fees and a percentage of yields!**

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Non-Custodial Architecture
```
Your Wallet
   ↓
FluxFi Smart Contract (Audited)
   ↓
Aave/Yearn Smart Contracts (Audited & Battle-Tested)

Your private keys: STAY IN YOUR WALLET ✅
FluxFi never has access to your funds ✅
All transactions on-chain & verifiable ✅
```

### Risk Factors
1. **Smart Contract Risk**:
   - We only use audited protocols (Aave, Yearn)
   - Risks: ~1-2% annually (historical data)

2. **Market Risk**:
   - Stablecoin depeg risk (USDC is extremely stable)
   - Vault yield variability

3. **AI Risk**:
   - Model makes wrong rebalancing decisions
   - Mitigation: Only rebalances for >1% APY difference
